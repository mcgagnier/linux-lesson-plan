//What is cron?

//It is a program in Unix that is used to execute commands or scripts automatically at a specified time/date.

//When to use a cron task?

//You may want to do an automatic email check from a piece of software you are working on and run it every 5 minutes. Or you might want to run a file clean up script that deletes garbage files every night. or every 3 days. Or maybe you are syncing data with an external database through a third party api, and instead of manually going and running that script every 15 minutes you want it to run automatically.

//Go to index.js for chron tasks
